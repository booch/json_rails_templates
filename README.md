JSON Rails Templates
====================

This gem allows you to write simple Rails views for JSON output.

When you want JSON output, you normally just define ``as_json`` on each
model, and ``respond_with`` the object. But sometimes you want the same
model to display differently from different controllers. In that case,
you have a few options:

1. Don't use the default ``respond_to``.

   You'd use specialized ``as_json`` methods, and have each controller
   call the appropriate specialized method. We went through this, and it
   did not work so well. We ended up with a lot of different ``as_json``
   methods. It felt like we were doing too much work in the models that
   did not feel like it belonged there.

1. Use a presenter class.

   We tried this as well, and it felt too heavy-handed. We ended up with
   lots of classes that didn't seem to be doing much.

   We're considering trying a variant of this called [DCI][http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data,_Context,_and_Interaction]
   (Data, Context, and Interaction). The idea is that the model contains
   only data, and when we need some behavior from the object, we inject a
   module into the object with the behavior only for that specific
   context. So each view would be considered a different context, with an
   ``as_json`` appropriate for that context.

1. Use a JSON view file.

   This seems the simplest, and fits in pretty well with the way Rails
   works, especially with HTML. It takes the (Rails-ish) perspective that
   we're just looking at different views of the same model object, and
   keeps these different views out of the model.

   We tried this with plain ERB, but it didn't work out too well -- we
   had to jump through some hoops to output raw text.


## Example ##

Assuming that ``@instance_variable`` is set to ``'instance variable'``
and ``exposed_variable`` returns ``'exposed "variable"'``,
this template:

    string_literal: 'this is a string'
    integer_literal: 123
    float_literal: 1.234
    boolean_literal: true
    string_expression: 'this is a string'.gsub('string', 'String!')
    integer_expression: 1 + 2
    float_expression: Math::PI * 2
    boolean_expression: 'Craig' == 'Buchek'
    array_literal: ['string', 123, 1.234, false]
    hash_literal: {'key1': 'value 1', key2: 'value 2', :key3 => 'value 3'}
    instance_variable: @instance_variable
    exposed_variable: exposed_variable

will render JSON equivalent to:

    {
      string_literal: 'this is a string',
      integer_literal: 123,
      float_literal: 1.234,
      boolean_literal: true,
      string_expression: 'this is a String!',
      integer_expression: 3,
      float_expression: 6.283185307179586,
      boolean_expression: false,
      array_literal: [
        'string',
        123,
        1.234,
        false
      ],
      hash_literal: {
        key1: 'value 1',
        key2: 'value 2',
        key3: 'value 3'
      },
      instance_variable: 'instance variable',
      exposed_variable: 'exposed "variable"',
    }


## TODO ##

Implement these translations:

1. array expression
1. hash expression
1. object
1. array of objects
1. partial
1. partial with an object
1. partial with a collection

Consider these ideas:

1. Use ``as_json`` where available for objects when there is no partial.
1. Translate dates/times to strings automatically.
1. Generate an error when encountering a date/time expression.
1. Generate an error when encountering an object with no partial or ``as_json``.
    a. May try ``to_json`` or ``to_hash`` as well.
1. Require or allow {} or [] around the top-level content.
1. Allow specifying a context, so we can just do ``attribute`` on the right side everywhere instead of ``resource.attribute``.
    a. Probably use a syntax like ``=object_or_hash``.
1. Override ``render()`` to return hashes and arrays instead of a string.
